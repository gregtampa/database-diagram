# Prototypes: #

Remember the good old days when databases were called Databases and required Big Iron machines to run on? No? Nor me.

Treat databases like interesting files, just make a new one called 'test\_dbd' add some tables that may relate to your application (e.g. [staff, customers, orders, items] or [blog\_posts, comments, authors, tags]) add primary and foreign keys. Now throw this into database-diagram and take a look.

# Version history #

Every time you change your database, keep a copy of the structure dump somewhere. Now you can view each step in the evolution of your DB.
